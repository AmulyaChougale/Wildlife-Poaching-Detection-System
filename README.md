# Wildlife-Poaching-Detection-System

Overview

Wildlife poaching remains a major threat to biodiversity. Traditional monitoring systems lack continuous surveillance and real-time response capability.

The project proposes a real-time detection system integrating YOLOv12 with a lightweight CNN architecture to enable accurate multi-species detection and deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Objectives 
1. Detect wildlife species and human presence in forest environments. 
 
2. Design a real-time detection system using YOLOv12.  
 
3. Develop a lightweight architecture suitable for edge deployment.  
 
4. Evaluate detection accuracy and real-time performance.

Outcomes 

1.Robust Multi-Class Wildlife Detection 

 YOLOv12 achieved reliable detection of multiple wildlife species and human presence across diverse forest scenarios.
 
 Detection accuracy remained consistent under varying environmental and lighting conditions. 
 
2.Stable Training and Model Convergence 

 Training and validation losses decreased steadily and converged smoothly during optimization. 
 
 Performance metrics stabilized after optimal epochs without signs of overfitting.
